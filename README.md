# SUV Car Data Analysis and Logistic Regression

## Overview

This project involves analyzing SUV car data to determine whether a customer will make a purchase based on various features. The analysis includes visualizations, data scaling, and logistic regression modeling to predict purchases. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the SUV car dataset.
   - Created histograms to understand the distribution of features.
   - Generated count plots to visualize categorical data.
   - Created a heatmap to explore correlations between features.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Applied standard scaling to normalize the feature data for better performance of the logistic regression model.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **Logistic Regression Modeling:**
   - Fitted a logistic regression model to the training data.
   - Made predictions on the test data to determine whether a purchase will be made.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Calculated the accuracy score of the logistic regression model, which is 82.5%.
   - Generated a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the model in more detail.
